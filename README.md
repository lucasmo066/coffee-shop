# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


To begin the application:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

The backend for the app is located in the coffee-backend repo:
https://github.com/lucasmo066/coffee-backend

This is the repo for the backend of the coffee shop app, clone into your desktop and then using the terminal navigate to the coffee-backend folder on your computer:

cd YOUR_PATH/coffee-backend

Once you are in the backend folder, type 'npm start'. The backend will open on localhost:3030

You can use whatever username you'd like!
